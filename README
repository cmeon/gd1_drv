gd1_drv
=======

This driver is for GD, a library for dynamic creation of PNG and JPEG
images: line drawing, polygons, text, and lots more.

See http://www.boutell.com/gd/ for source distributions for GD, which
is a prerequisite for attempting to build this driver.  Please follow
the instructions later in this file to build the libgd.so shared
library.

The only functions in the GD API that are not supported are:
gdImageCreateFromPngSource(), gdImageDashedLine(), gdImageString16()
and gdImageStringUp16(), and True-Type font functions.  Why the
True-Type font functions?

  1. I don't have the fonts installed on my machine,

  2. EDTK cannot currently pass floating-point values.

Once you've compiled and installed libgd.so and the GD header files
(gd.h, gd_io.h, ...), you'll *must* follow the instructions found in
the file GDConfig.mk.sample.

Once everything is compiled cleanly, run the regression test:

     % cd CVSROOT/jungerl/lib/gd1_drv/test
     % make test

You should see the message "All regression tests PASSED."

If you have problems compiling or using this driver, please email me
at slfritchie at snookles dot com.


Creating a shared library version of libgd
==========================================

You will need to compile & install the GD library (version 1.8.4,
please!).  Unfortunately, the build scheme used by GD 1.8.4 does not
create a shared library.  So, you'll have to resort to some brutal
hacks to do so.  Fortunately, it's pretty easy to do.

0. Get the source distribution for libgd version 1.8.4.  Unpack it
   someplace.

1. Apply the patch below to the top-level "Makefile".  This should
   work if you're using GCC for your compiler.  If not, you may need
   to do whatever equivalent things for your compiler & linker.  You
   may need to use "-fpic" instead of "-fPIC", for example.

   NOTE: The patch adds "-ljpeg" to the list of libraries added to the
   libgd.so shared library.  If you do not include libjpeg, you will
   probably have problems with unresolvable symbols later on.

2. Follow the instructions in "index.html".  See the "How do I build
   gd?" link near the top of that file to jump to the compilation
   instructions.

   You will want to build a version that has support for libpng and
   libjpeg.  This driver does not implement GD's TrueType font
   functions, so don't bother trying to compile for it.

Here's the patch for "Makefile".  Change directory to the top of the
GD source distribution, then run "patch < /path/to/this/README".
